This news is from Tasmania. A woman sees a dead wombat on the road. She goes up to it. She sees that its pouch is moving. There is a baby wombat inside!
She helps the baby out of the pouch. It is cold so she puts it in a towel. Another woman takes care of the baby wombat. She keeps it in her bra. This keeps the baby warm. Also, it feels like a pouch to the baby. The baby spends three months in the bra.
Difficult words: wombat (an animal with a pouch which lives in Australia), pouch (a pocket on animals like wombats, kangaroos and koalas for carrying babies), take care (to help).
You can watch the original video in the Level 3 section.
